# SnowSentry: Avalanche Prediction System

## Overview
SnowSentry is an AI-driven avalanche prediction and mitigation system designed to enhance safety in avalanche-prone areas. By leveraging deep learning techniques, SnowSentry provides real-time, user-specific avalanche risk assessments, predicting the location, time, and severity of potential avalanches. This system integrates a timeseries forecasting model, a classification model, and a computer vision model to offer a comprehensive approach to avalanche detection.

## Features
- **Real-time Avalanche Prediction:** Utilizes weather data and user location to predict potential avalanches.
- **Multi-Model Integration:** Combines timeseries forecasting, classification, and computer vision models for accurate predictions.
- **User-Specific Alerts:** Sends SMS notifications to users and rescue teams in case of high avalanche risk.
- **Impact Zone Identification:** Identifies and visualizes areas that may be affected by avalanches.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly website for accessing predicted weather, viewing affected areas, and receiving notifications.
- **Backend and Database Management:** Efficient user authentication, data storage, and system management.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Seamless deployment of models and the web interface on cloud platforms.

## Technology Stack
